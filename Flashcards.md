Micro:bit
?
A simple microcontroller

Input
?
A signal or data received by the system. e.g. button presses, voice commands, or sensor readings.

Output
?
The information produced by a system. E.g. Sound, LED light displays or robot movement.

Sensor
?
A measurement component e.g. microphone, thermometer, ultrasonic distance sensor

Algorithm
?
A set of step-by-step procedures or instructions designed to perform a specific task. A computer program.

Servo Motor
?
A type of motor that can move to a specified position. Used to control movement with a high level of precision.

Microcontroller
?
A compact integrated circuit. A tiny, dedicated computer.

Binary Code
?
Representing text or computer processor instructions by the use of the binary number system's two-binary digits 0 and 1.

Circuit
?
A circuit is a closed path that allows electric current to flow from one point to another. 

Actuator
?
Component of a machine that moves or controls a mechanism e.g. motors or gears

GPIO
?
General Purpose Input Output. The input and output pins  / slots in a microcontroller

Conditional 
?
An if statement in a program

Iteration
?
A loop in a program.

Resistor
?
A component that slows the flow of electric current. 

Capacitor
?
A component that stores. It can release it when needed. The circuit symbol for a capacitor is two parallel lines.

Diode
?
A component that allows current to flow in one direction but not the other. Used to protect circuits by preventing current from flowing backward.

Transistor
?
A switch controlled by electricity, rather than moving parts.

Integrated Circuit (IC)
?
An integrated circuit is a set of electronic circuits on a small chip of semiconductor material. A 'chip' on a PCB.

Battery
?
Converts stored chemical energy into electrical energy. 

LED 
?
A Light Emitting Diode. A diode that lights up when current is passed through it. 

Switch
?
A component that can break an electrical circuit, interrupting the current or diverting it from one conductor to another.

Ground
?
The return path for electrical circuits. I.e. returning to the black terminal.
