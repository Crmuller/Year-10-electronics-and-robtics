Micro:bit
?
Micro:bit is a pocket-sized computer introduced by the BBC to help teach kids about programming and computer science. It has various features such as LED lights, buttons, and sensors.

LED (Light Emitting Diode)
?
An LED is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current is passed through it. LEDs are commonly used in various types of electronic devices.

Input
?
In electronics and robotics, an input is a signal or data received by the system. Examples of inputs include button presses, voice commands, or sensor readings.

Output
?
Output is the information produced by a system. This could be in the form of light, sound, motion, or other forms of data. Examples of outputs in robotics include LED light displays or robot movement.

Sensor
?
A sensor is a device that detects or measures a physical property and records, indicates, or otherwise responds to it. In robotics, sensors might detect light, sound, temperature, or proximity to objects.

Algorithm
?
An algorithm is a set of step-by-step procedures or instructions designed to perform a specific task. In programming and robotics, algorithms are used to control behavior.

Programming
?
Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. When we program the micro:bit, we're deciding what it should do and how it should do it.

Servo Motor
?
A servo motor is a type of motor that can move to a specified position. In robotics, they are often used to control movement with a high level of precision.

Microcontroller
?
A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern specific operations in an embedded system. It's essentially a tiny, dedicated computer.

Binary Code
?
Binary code is a system of representing text or computer processor instructions by the use of the binary number system's two-binary digits 0 and 1.

Bluetooth
?
Bluetooth is a wireless technology used for exchanging data over short distances. The micro:bit can use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices or the internet.

Block-based Programming
?
Block-based programming is a form of coding where you manipulate coding elements graphically rather than by typing text. It's often used in educational settings as a simplified introduction to programming.

Circuit
?
A circuit is a closed path that allows electric current to flow from one point to another. It may include various electrical components, like resistors, capacitors, and transistors.

Actuator
?
An actuator is a component of a machine that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. In robotics, actuators often take the form of motors that can turn gears.

Breadboard
?
A breadboard is a device for prototyping electronic circuits by inserting components and wires into a grid of interconnected points without the need for soldering.

GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)
?
GPIO pins are a physical interface between a microcontroller (like the micro:bit) and other electronics. They allow the microcontroller to communicate with other devices, like sensors, LEDs, and motors.

Loop
?
In programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is met. Loops are used in robotics to continuously check sensor values or repeat actions.

Conditional Statement
?
Conditional statements, also known as if-then statements, perform different computations or actions depending on whether a condition is evaluated as true or false.

Resistor
?
A resistor is a component that resists the flow of electric current. It is used to control the amount of current in a circuit. The circuit symbol for a resistor is a zigzag line.

Capacitor
?
A capacitor is a component that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It can release the stored energy when needed. The circuit symbol for a capacitor is two parallel lines.

Diode
?
A diode is a component that allows current to flow in one direction but not the other. It is often used to protect circuits by preventing current from flowing backward. The circuit symbol for a diode is a line with an arrow pointing to a line perpendicular to it.

Transistor
?
A transistor is a device that can amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. It is an essential building block of modern electronic devices. The circuit symbol for a transistor varies depending on the type, but generally involves circles or lines with arrows.

Integrated Circuit (IC)
?
An integrated circuit is a set of electronic circuits on a small chip of semiconductor material. It can function as an amplifier, oscillator, timer, counter, or microprocessor. The circuit symbol for an IC is a rectangle with multiple lines (representing connections) coming out of it.

Battery
?
A battery is a device consisting of one or more electrochemical cells that convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy. The circuit symbol for a battery is a series of alternating short and long lines.

LED (Light Emitting Diode)
?
An LED is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current is passed through it. The circuit symbol for an LED is a diode symbol with two small arrows pointing away from it, indicating that light is being emitted.

Switch
?
A switch is a component that can break an electrical circuit, interrupting the current or diverting it from one conductor to another. The circuit symbol for a switch is a break in a line with a short line nearby and an angle between the two.

Inductor
?
An inductor is a passive electronic component that stores energy in the form of a magnetic field. It is often used in filtering applications or to block AC while allowing DC to pass. The circuit symbol for an inductor is a coil or looped line.

Fuse
?
A fuse is a protective device that melts and breaks an electric circuit if the current exceeds a safe level. The circuit symbol for a fuse is a small rectangle or a line with a circle in the middle.

Ground
?
Ground, in the context of electrical circuits, is the reference point in an electrical circuit from which voltages are measured, a common return path for electric current, or a direct physical connection to the earth. The circuit symbol for ground is often a series of lines that get shorter, representing the ground.
