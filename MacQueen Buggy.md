In this section you will be presented with two challenges. It is up to you to come up with a solution to these challenges. You will be marked based on your solution's elegance and effectiveness. 

Once task 0 is complete, they may be completed in any order.

# Task 1 
Your challenge: Make the MacQueen move in a square. There is no mark for this task.

Picture:

Code:

# Task 2
Your challenge: Make the buggy follow a line. Use the maps provided

## Rubric
Achieved: Your buggy follows the line for a minimum of 15s and corrects its direction at least twice. 

Merit: Your buggy can follow the line, turn corners and handles intersections. It does not get stuck in dead ends. You have put some thought into the functioning of your code. 

Excellence: Your buggy follows the line handles all parts of the map and cannot be forced to fail even when deliberately trying. Your code is elegant. 


# Task 3:
Your challenge: Solve a maze

## Rubric
Achieved: Your buggy made it to the end of the maze. Maybe it was sheer luck, or maybe you programmed each turn into it. But it got to the end. 

Merit: Your buggy solved the maze and could reliably solve any maze that it was presented with, but it uses some kind of human input.

Excellence: Your buggy solves the maze all by itself. It can do so multiple times, and requires no human input to do it.
